# CSSE2310 - Assignment 1 (C)
- Introduction to C programming through making a small linux command-line program which operates on user input. This program is called unjumble and displays an anagram utilising words entered by the user.

- This features dynamic memory allocation, memory management, pointer usage, file IO, streams and other intermediate C programming syntax/ methods

- This program imports provided libraries, and thus cannot be "made" without them, the code in this repository is just representative of the assignment 1 development.
